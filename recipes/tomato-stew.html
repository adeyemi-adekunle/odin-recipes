    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Nigerian tomato stew has a lovely red hue and delicious bold flavors.With
        rich tomatoes as its flavor base, this stew is truly enticing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additional flavor agents include onions, bouillon, curry, thyme, garlic,
        and peppers. What gives its distinct flavor, though, is the gamey ram.
        Because it's very expensive, this protein is considered celebratory meat
        and is often only served during special occasions, such as the Islamic
        holiday, Eid-el Kabir.
