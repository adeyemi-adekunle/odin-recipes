    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Nigerian tomato stew has a lovely red hue and delicious bold flavors.With
        rich tomatoes as its flavor base, this stew is truly enticing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additional flavor agents include onions, bouillon, curry, thyme, garlic,
        and peppers. What gives its distinct flavor, though, is the gamey ram.
        Because it's very expensive, this protein is considered celebratory meat
        and is often only served during special occasions, such as the Islamic
        holiday, Eid-el Kabir.

        <small>In a large pot Cook the blended tomato mixture on medium heat until it
            forms a paste. It should reduce to about half its volume. While the

            set it aside. In the same pot, heat the oil on medium heat and
            caramelize the onions until it is mostly softened. Add the tomato paste
            to the caramelized onions and add the cook on low- medium heat for 5
            minutes.</small>
        <li>Add meat stock and spices</li>
        <small>After 5 minutes, pour in the stock, and season with bouillon, dried thyme and curry powder. Stir and
            continue to cook for another 10 minutes on low heat.</small>
