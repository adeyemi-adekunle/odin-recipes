    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Egusi soup is a Nigerian delicacy that features ground melon or pumpkin
      seeds as its main ingredient. Other ingredients include meat or seafood,
      fermented beans, onions, and vegetables
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of ingredients makes for a flavorful soup. Thanks to the
      pumpkin seeds (egusi), this soup has a wonderful nuttiness to it. The rest
      of the ingredients add salty, savory, and spicy flavors as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hearty soup is most commonly eaten with pounded yam, which is a
      dough-based dish made of, surprise pounded yam.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Seafood</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup Crayfish</li>
      <li>2 lbs Meats and fish</li>
      <li>1 Shrimp seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Produce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup Greens</li>
      <li>1 Habanero pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Oils and Vinegars</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup Palm oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Others</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups Egusi (not ground)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps or Directions</h3>
    <h4>Egusi soup happens in three main steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil the meats and/or fish you intend to use. Preferably do this the day
        before so making your egusi soup is easy the next day.
      </li>

      <li>
        Grind the egusi. I advise that you always buy whole egusi seeds and
        grind them yourself. That way you are sure of the quality of the seeds.
        Pre-ground egusi is not always the best.
      </li>

      <li>
        Saute onions in red palm oil, cook egusi in red palm oil then add the
        boiled meats, crayfish and seasoning. It is really that easy!
      </li>
